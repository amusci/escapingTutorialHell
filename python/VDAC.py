'''

In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a binary representation of that signal into an analog output. An 8 bit converter can represent a maximum of 2^8 different values, with each successive value differing by 1/256 of the full scale value, this becomes the system resolution.

Create a function that takes a decimal number representation of a signal and returns the analog voltage level that would be created by a DAC if it were given the same number in binary.

While value range is 0-1023, reference range is 0-5.00 volts. Value and reference is directly proportional.

This DAC has 10 bits of resolution and the DAC reference is set at 5.00 volts.
